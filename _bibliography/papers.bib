  title={Learning shallow quantum circuits with many-qubit gates},
  author={Vasconcelos, Francisca and Huang, Hsin-Yuan},
  abstract={We present the first computationally-efficient algorithm for average-case learning of shallow quantum circuits with many-qubit gates. Specifically, we provide a quasi-polynomial time and sample complexity algorithm for learning unknown QAC0 circuits -- constant-depth circuits with arbitrary single-qubit gates and polynomially many CZ gates of unbounded width -- up to inverse-polynomially small error. Furthermore, we show that the learned unitary can be efficiently synthesized in poly-logarithmic depth. This work expands the family of efficiently learnable quantum circuits, notably since in finite-dimensional circuit geometries, QAC0 circuits require polynomial depth to implement.},

  title={A Quadratic Speedup in Finding Nash Equilibria of Quantum Zero-Sum Games},
  author={Vasconcelos*, Francisca and Vlatakis-Gkaragkounis*, Emmanouil-Vasileios and Mertikopoulos, Panayotis and Piliouras, Giorgios and Jordan, Michael I.},
  abstract={Recent developments in domains such as non-local games, quantum interactive proofs, and quantum generative adversarial networks have renewed interest in quantum game theory and, specifically, quantum zero-sum games. Central to classical game theory is the efficient algorithmic computation of Nash equilibria, which represent optimal strategies for both players. In 2008, Jain and Watrous proposed the first classical algorithm for computing equilibria in quantum zero-sum games using the Matrix Multiplicative Weight Updates (MMWU) method to achieve a convergence rate of $O(d/\epsilon<sup>2</sup>)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in the $4<sup>d</sup>$-dimensional spectraplex. In this work, we propose a hierarchy of quantum optimization algorithms that generalize MMWU via an extra-gradient mechanism. Notably, within this proposed hierarchy, we introduce the Optimistic Matrix Multiplicative Weights Update (OMMWU) algorithm and establish its average-iterate convergence complexity as $O(d/\epsilon)$ iterations to $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria. This quadratic speed-up relative to Jain and Watrous' original algorithm sets a new benchmark for computing $\epsilon$-Nash equilibria in quantum zero-sum games.},

  title={On the Pauli Spectrum of QAC<sup>0</sup>},
  author={Nadimpalli*, Shivam and Parham*, Natalie and Vasconcelos*, Francisca and Yuen*, Henry},
  abstract={The circuit class QAC<sup>0</sup> was introduced by Moore (1999) as a model for constant depth quantum circuits where the gate set includes many-qubit Toffoli gates. Proving lower bounds against such circuits is a longstanding challenge in quantum circuit complexity; in particular, showing that polynomial-size QAC<sup>0</sup> cannot compute the parity function has remained an open question for over 20 years. In this work, we identify a notion of the <i>Pauli spectrum</i> of QAC<sup>0</sup> circuits, which can be viewed as the quantum analogue of the Fourier spectrum of classical AC<sup>0</sup> circuits. We conjecture that the Pauli spectrum of $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ circuits satisfies <i>low-degree concentration</i>, in analogy to the famous Linial, Nisan, Mansour theorem on the low-degree Fourier concentration of AC<sup>0</sup> circuits. If true, this conjecture immediately implies that polynomial-size QAC<sup>0</sup> circuits cannot compute parity. We prove this conjecture for the class of depth-$d$, polynomial-size QAC<sup>0</sup> circuits with at most n^{O(1/d)} auxiliary qubits. We obtain new circuit lower bounds and learning results as applications:  this class of circuits cannot correctly compute: (1) the $n$-bit parity function on more than $(1/2 + 2^(-\Omega(n<sup>1/d</sup>)))$-fraction of inputs, and (2) the $n$-bit majority function on more than $(1 - 1/poly(n))$-fraction of inputs. Additionally we show that this class of QAC<sup>0</sup> circuits with limited auxiliary qubits can be learned with quasipolynomial sample complexity, giving the first learning result for QAC<sup>0</sup> circuits. More broadly, our results add evidence that ``Pauli-analytic'' techniques can be a powerful tool in studying quantum circuits.},

  abstract={Implicit neural representations (INRs) have achieved impressive results for scene reconstruction and computer graphics, where their performance has primarily been assessed on reconstruction accuracy. As INRs make their way into other domains, where model predictions inform high-stakes decision-making, uncertainty quantification of INR inference is becoming critical. To that end, we study a Bayesian reformulation of INRs, UncertaINR, in the context of computed tomography, and evaluate several Bayesian deep learning implementations in terms of accuracy and calibration.  We find that they achieve well-calibrated uncertainty, while retaining accuracy competitive with other classical, INR-based, and CNN-based reconstruction techniques. Contrary to common intuition in the Bayesian deep learning literature, we find that INRs obtain the best calibration with computationally efficient Monte Carlo dropout, outperforming Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and deep ensembles. Moreover, in contrast to the best-performing prior approaches, UncertaINR does not require a large training dataset, but only a handful of validation images.},

  abstract={Technologies that rely on quantum bits (qubits) require long coherence times and high-fidelity operations. Superconducting qubits are one of the leading platforms for achieving these objectives. However, the coherence of superconducting qubits is affected by the breaking of Cooper pairs of electrons. The experimentally observed density of the broken Cooper pairs, referred to as quasiparticles, is orders of magnitude higher than the value predicted at equilibrium by the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity. Previous work has shown that infrared photons considerably increase the quasiparticle density, yet even in the best-isolated systems, it remains much higher than expected, suggesting that another generation mechanism exists. Here we provide evidence that ionizing radiation from environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays contributes to this observed difference. The effect of ionizing radiation leads to an elevated quasiparticle density, which we predict would ultimately limit the coherence times of superconducting qubits of the type measured here to milliseconds. We further demonstrate that radiation shielding reduces the flux of ionizing radiation and thereby increases the energy-relaxation time. Albeit a small effect for today's qubits, reducing or mitigating the impact of ionizing radiation will be critical for realizing fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computers.},

  abstract={Realizing a fully connected network of quantum processors requires the ability to distribute quantum entanglement. For distant processing nodes, this can be achieved by generating, routing, and capturing spatially entangled itinerant photons. In this work, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of such photons using superconducting transmon qubits that are directly coupled to a waveguide. In particular, we generate two-photon N00N states and show that the state and spatial entanglement of the emitted photons are tunable via the qubit frequencies. Using quadrature amplitude detection, we reconstruct the moments and correlations of the photonic modes and demonstrate state preparation fidelities of 84%. Our results provide a path toward realizing quantum communication and teleportation protocols using itinerant photons generated by quantum interference within a waveguide quantum electrodynamics architecture.},

  abstract={Quantum state tomography (QST), or the reconstruction of the density matrix of a quantum state via measurements, is critcal to ensure the proper functionality of qubits and quantum operations in a quantum computer. In this work, we extend existing QST code based on Maximum Likelihood Estimation from two to an arbitrary number of qubits and from one to arbitrarily many energy levels. A 100x algorithmic speedup is achieved over the original implementation. However, the exponential scaling of the density matrix makes this MLE-based algorithm infeasible for analysis over 6-qubits on a standard computer. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a novel deep-learning based approach to QST. Utilizing the CycleGAN architecture from the field of computer vision, we aim to address the issues of scalability and bias that plague current QST implementations.},

  title={Person-Following UAVs},
  author={Vasconcelos, Francisca and Vasconcelos, Nuno},
  abstract={We consider the design of vision-based control algorithms for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), so as to enable a UAV to autonomously follow a person. A new vision-based control architecture is proposed with the goals of 1) robustly following the user and 2) implementing following behaviors programmed by manipulation of visual patterns. This is achieved within a detection/tracking paradigm, where the target is a programmable badge worn by the user. This badge contains a visual pattern with two components. The first is fixed and used to locate the user. The second is variable and implements a code used to program the UAV behavior. A biologically inspired tracking/recognition architecture, combining bottom-up and top-down saliency mechanisms, a novel image similarity measure, and an affine validation procedure, is proposed to detect the badge in the scene. The badge location is used by a control algorithm to adjust the UAV flight parameters so as to maintain the user in the center of the field of view. The detected badge is further analyzed to extract the visual code that commands the UAV behavior This is used to control the height and distance of the UAV relative to the user.},
