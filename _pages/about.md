<p>I am a second-year PhD student in the UC Berkeley Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. My research is supported by the <a href="https://www.nsfgrfp.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship</a> and <a href="https://www.pdsoros.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans</a>. I am co-advised by Profs <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jordan/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Michael Jordan</a> and <a href="http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~vazirani/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Umesh Vazirani</a>.
My research interests lie at the intersection of quantum computation and machine learning theory.</p>

<p>In 2020, I received a BS in EECS and Physics from MIT, where I was fortunate to do substantial undergraduate research advised by Prof <a href="https://equs.mit.edu/william-d-oliver/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">William Oliver</a> in the <a href="https://equs.mit.edu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">MIT Engineering Quantum Systems</a> group. As an undergraduate, I also interned under Dr. <a href="https://marcusps.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Marcus da Silva</a> at Rigetti Computing and Microsoft Research Quantum. Supported by a <a href="https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/scholarships/the-rhodes-scholarship/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Rhodes Scholarship</a>, I received two masters from the University of Oxford: an MSc in Statistical Sciences and MSt in Philosophy of Physics. Following from the MSc, I performed statistical ML research in the <a href="https://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">OxCSML</a> group, advised by Prof <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Yee Whye Teh</a>.</p>

<p>I am also the Founding Academic Director of the <a href="https://www.qubitbyqubit.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Qubit x Qubit (QxQ)</a> initiative of <a href="https://the-cs.org/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Coding School (TCS)</a> non-profit. Since 2019, we have taught 20,000+ diverse K-12 students, undergraduates, and members of the workforce worldwide about the fundamentals of quantum computing and QISE.</p>
